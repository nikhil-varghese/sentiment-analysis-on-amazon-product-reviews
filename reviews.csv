  Oxford dictionaries have been the best and they would be. All contents are appropriately explained. But the size on name of pocket is bit large. Maybe you can get a custom pocket sewn in your clothes for the dictionary. ..

  No issues content wise. However I bought it taking the heading on its literal value. It is cwrtainly not fit for the pocket - shirt or trouser or coat. Certainly big enough and weighs much. Now have to buy another one that can be carried to the school without breaking the back!

  Type: HardcoverLanguage: English-EnglishOverall: Best that you can get in the price rangeVerdict: Go for it.This is the eleventh edition of Pocket English Dictionary by Oxford. It's a Hardcover Edition. The packaging was great, every measure was followed in order to abide by the pandemic. This contains an awesome and important compilation of every day-to-day words and much of the words that you might have found out in a foreign literature book. For me, who reads a lot of literature and comes across 11-12 new words a day, this is a go-to whenever I want to make some sense. It also contains some tips and some queries that people who are unaware of the regular usage of a foreign language ask. Like ""the noun descendant ends with -ant, not -ent. "", it's applications are much more. For me I'll definitely recommended someone this dictionary.

It's a Hardcover Edition. The packaging was great, every measure was followed in order to abide by the pandemic. This contains an awesome and important compilation of every day-to-day words and much of the words that you might have found out in a foreign literature book. For me, who reads a lot of literature and comes across 11-12 new words a day, this is a go-to whenever I want to make some sense. It also contains some tips and some queries that people who are unaware of the regular usage of a foreign language ask. Like ""the noun descendant ends with -ant, not -ent. "", it's applications are much more. For me I'll definitely recommended someone this dictionary.

  Type: HardcoverLanguage: English-EnglishOverall: Best that you can get in the price rangeVerdict: Go for it.This is the eleventh edition of Pocket English Dictionary by Oxford. It's a Hardcover Edition. The packaging was great, every measure was followed in order to abide by the pandemic. This contains an awesome and important compilation of every day-to-day words and much of the words that you might have found out in a foreign literature book. For me, who reads a lot of literature and comes across 11-12 new words a day, this is a go-to whenever I want to make some sense. It also contains some tips and some queries that people who are unaware of the regular usage of a foreign language ask. Like ""the noun descendant ends with -ant, not -ent. "", it's applications are much more. For me I'll definitely recommended someone this dictionary.

  Type: HardcoverLanguage: English-EnglishOverall: Best that you can get in the price rangeVerdict: Go for it.This is the eleventh edition of Pocket English Dictionary by Oxford. It's a Hardcover Edition. The packaging was great, every measure was followed in order to abide by the pandemic. This contains an awesome and important compilation of every day-to-day words and much of the words that you might have found out in a foreign literature book. For me, who reads a lot of literature and comes across 11-12 new words a day, this is a go-to whenever I want to make some sense. It also contains some tips and some queries that people who are unaware of the regular usage of a foreign language ask. Like ""the noun descendant ends with -ant, not -ent. "", it's applications are much more. For me I'll definitely recommended someone this dictionary.

  No issues content wise. However I bought it taking the heading on its literal value. It is cwrtainly not fit for the pocket - shirt or trouser or coat. Certainly big enough and weighs much. Now have to buy another one that can be carried to the school without breaking the back!

  Type: HardcoverLanguage: English-EnglishOverall: Best that you can get in the price rangeVerdict: Go for it.This is the eleventh edition of Pocket English Dictionary by Oxford. It's a Hardcover Edition. The packaging was great, every measure was followed in order to abide by the pandemic. This contains an awesome and important compilation of every day-to-day words and much of the words that you might have found out in a foreign literature book. For me, who reads a lot of literature and comes across 11-12 new words a day, this is a go-to whenever I want to make some sense. It also contains some tips and some queries that people who are unaware of the regular usage of a foreign language ask. Like ""the noun descendant ends with -ant, not -ent. "", it's applications are much more. For me I'll definitely recommended someone this dictionary.

  Though the jacket looks great but itâ€™s not an original product. I guess They are faking the name of Oxford publisher .... page quality is similar to photocopy papers. I think I will return the product and buy from a bookstore.
