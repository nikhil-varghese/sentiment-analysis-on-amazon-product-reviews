0,5.0,Worth for your moneyüí∞ Go for it,"  It's good, but it's not pocket dictionary, I mean it don't fit in your pocket, but it's also too handy to use... Go for it if you are looking for handy dictionary to use.."
1,4.0,"Best on content & quality, but big on size",  Oxford dictionaries have been the best and they would be. All contents are appropriately explained. But the size on name of pocket is bit large. Maybe you can get a custom pocket sewn in your clothes for the dictionary. ..
2,4.0,Not a small one,  No issues content wise. However I bought it taking the heading on its literal value. It is cwrtainly not fit for the pocket - shirt or trouser or coat. Certainly big enough and weighs much. Now have to buy another one that can be carried to the school without breaking the back!
3,5.0,"When it comes to dictionaries, I trust none other then Oxford","  Type: HardcoverLanguage: English-EnglishOverall: Best that you can get in the price rangeVerdict: Go for it.This is the eleventh edition of Pocket English Dictionary by Oxford. It's a Hardcover Edition. The packaging was great, every measure was followed in order to abide by the pandemic. This contains an awesome and important compilation of every day-to-day words and much of the words that you might have found out in a foreign literature book. For me, who reads a lot of literature and comes across 11-12 new words a day, this is a go-to whenever I want to make some sense. It also contains some tips and some queries that people who are unaware of the regular usage of a foreign language ask. Like ""the noun descendant ends with -ant, not -ent. "", it's applications are much more. For me I'll definitely recommended someone this dictionary."
4,3.0,Not a pocket dictionary,  Remove the word Pocket from the title. Its highly misleading. I wonder which pocket they are referring to.But dictionary is super.
5,4.0,Xcllnt product n no reviews reqd when it comes to ...,  Xcllnt product n no reviews reqd when it comes to Oxford books. I already have an Oxford dictionary but it ws too large n heavy for my 6 yr old son to use by himself. This pocket size ws ideal to use n he uses it everyday by himself.
6,1.0,page quality is similar to photocopy papers,  Though the jacket looks great but it‚Äôs not an original product. I guess They are faking the name of Oxford publisher .... page quality is similar to photocopy papers. I think I will return the product and buy from a bookstore.
7,4.0,Quality Brand,  Kids enjoy looking for the english meanings...easy to Locate the Spelling and word which you were searching for.

9,3.0,Can't be carried in a pocket.,"  Though dictionary is a good one and quite informative, it is quite thick and large to be carried in a pocket. It is not a 'pocket' dictionary."
10,5.0,NotHing comforts you in the chanGing uncertain times like a good old oxford dictionary,"  Makes me nostalgic while gladdening my heart. NotHing comforts you in the chanGing uncertain times like a good old oxford dictionary. I wish I could buy , thumb through and treasure all of its different variants and editions. Maybe some day."
11,4.0,Not Pocket Size,  Pocket Size isn‚Äôt the name I will give it as it won‚Äôt fit in Pocket or Purse.

16,5.0,Best among all compact dictionaries,"  Absolutely brilliant, a compact but comprehensive and reliable dictionary. Hard bound cover , and clear white pages of good quality make this a treasure to own for life. However, buying Concise Oxford Dictionary (South Asia Edition)- be a wiser decision as it is the final authority on English and ensures u will never miss a word in your lifetime"

240,3.0,size was an issue,  It was given that it is pocket dictionary.  But I don't whose pocket it will fit into
241,3.0,Pocket Oxford English South Asia Edition,"  The Delivery was on time by Amazon as usual.But the Quality of Printing & Paper is Just Average. The Dictionary is Bigger than Pocket Dictionary.A Pocket Dictionary is the one which fits into your pocket or Can come in your Hands Easily. It is bigger than that. The dictionary is Bigger than Pocket size and smaller than the Normal Size Dictionary.It is 18.5 centimetres(cm) in Height, 12.5 cm Length and 5 cm width(‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ü‡§æ‡§à). It is a Eleventh Reprint Edition in 2014, means Eleventh edition was released in 2013 and its a reprint of 11th edition in 2014.The Outer cover is Hard .Looks wise and quality wise the cover is good and sturdy. If the same quality would have been maintained in the pages and printing as well, then it would have been a very good dictionary.Printing is also not very good. overall Good dictionary (‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ö‡§≤‡§æ‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡•á). I can't verify the quality of contents, b'z I didnt get more time to look for words. Today especially in India every publisher is more concerned about price (trying to give less price), but on quality no one bothers. If they give quality on paper and printing ,then the overall cost also increased. This will ultimately result in lesser margin for Publishers."
242,4.0,A Handy Dictionary,"  I received the dictionary, a new book in mint condition, on third day after ordering. The dictionary (hard bound) is quite handy (size) but bit heavy for a pocket dictionary or a 9-10 yr old kid to take to school on a regular basis (given that bags r already heavy with book/notebook).  The word list is longer than many pocket dictionary, good paper quality, and origin of word is also given. Every now and then u find boxed item for a word which are tricky or have multiple meaning or usage of the word."
243,1.0,I feel bad on that situation,"  Delivery boy has rude behaviour. He has not follow delivery rules. He made a phone call from a distance place from my home and said to me that  he was vist my home 2 times, and our front gate in inside locking position and collected that item on that far place .But I refused to go that place as I was already be in my home with my family members, as Miladinabi holiday,after a ten miniuits later he came to my house front gate and delivered that item with  unpolietly behaviour with shouting at me. I feel bad on that situation .Don't repeat this type of accidental situations in further."
244,5.0,Appearance is good,"  Have not yet gone through the Dictionary because I received a defective one so I returned but by having a look over it, it seems to be a good product. Also consider other user ratings, especially one in which a user by quoting a word from the Bible has described how Oxford has not clarified various old English terms."
245,5.0,As usual excellent quality product,"  This dictionary is superb for its functionality and usage as is meant to be carried by my nine year old for daily usage at school. As usual excellent quality product.Mono color printing rather than smudged blue color printing some dictionaries have. This product is very good. However It does not include synonyms, antonyms and usage. This dictionary is only about spelling, pronunciation and immediate meaning. I have another six bulky dictionaries for further understanding of the word of interest."
246,1.0,Misleading name,  The product was unsuitable as it was not at all pocket sized or portable. It is heavy and bulky and not useful for carrying to to school by kids.
247,4.0,Good one,  The cover is very good and the explanation are just one liner

273,5.0,Pocket Dictionary.,"  I ordered this for my 8 year grand daughter who is just starting to want to look up words that she doesn't know the meaning of. However I was very disappointed that what is called a ''pocket'' dictionary is actually full size! I wanted her to be able to carry it around with her in her school bag etc and now she leaves it on her bedroom table and it doesn't get used as much as I hoped. To me, a pocket dictionary is just that - something you can carry around in your pocket! Having said all that, the delivery was very fast and arrived when promised and it arrived in very good condition."
274,1.0,It'll only fit in your pocket if you're the BFG!,  Asked to get my son a pocket dictionary for his new secondary school. This arrived! It's not going to fit in any pocket and hardly fits in his school bag. It's heavy for him to lump about all day and if I could be bothered I'd send it back.Don't waste your money if you're wanting something small and portable.Mis-sold!

364,4.0,"iridium sporran, yes; but no crap panzer: very good, but could be better.","  All our former dictionaries (paper, that is, as opposed to digital) are old and inherited. This is the first brand new dictionary we've ever had. Quite apart from loving words, and liking to be able to look them up either when needed, or even just for fun, we sometimes enjoy a game or three of Scrabble, and we're hoping this will be more up to date than all our old hand-me-downs.I wouldn't be surprised if some other reviewers compare this exact format and edition to previous iterations. That's not something I can do, so I'll approach my review in a more ad hoc 'how I use a dictionary' manner. First of all I just decided to pluck ten random words from the ether, and see if this volume contained them.Let's see (x = no, / = yes):1) rambunctious - x2) crap - x3) sedulous - /4) latte - /5) panzer - x (but f√ºhrer - /!)6) colloquial - /7) modem - /8) iridium - / (& einsteinium!*)9) zeitgeist - /10) sporran - /* one suspects that all the elements will be in there.So, 7/10... Not bad, but could be better.And what of the quality? Well, under 'shag' we have (my renderings are much abbreviated): n1 - tobacco, adj - carpet, n2 - bird, but not v - (colloq) intercourse! Considering how common such terms as 'crap' and 'shag' are, I think it's fairly poor not have the first at all, and not to define the second in one of its most commonly used senses. But on the whole, the definitions are pleasingly clear and concise.I noticed a large number of modern gizmo-related and colloq. entries, such as 'creepy-crawly' and 'modem'. In this respect this dictionary clearly appears to be aiming to remain up to date, a tough ask in a world filled with digital dictionaries. So, perhaps I need to invest in a bigger dictionary, to find all the words I'm after. This is, after all, a Concise edition. But it's eminently portable, well made/printed, and highly useful. A worthwhile investment."
365,1.0,Ab√Æm√©,"  Il est arriv√© ab√Æm√©, j √©tais d√©√ßu car un dictionnaire est cens√© √™tre garder longtemps et la fes le d√©but il est ab√Æm√©"
366,5.0,Perfect dictionary for every-day use,"  This review refers to the eleventh edition (published 2013) which comes eight years after the tenth edition and now contains over 120,000 words and phrases with definitions. This latest edition includes more than 100 new entries such as `app' and `cybersecurity' and modern revisions of at least 100 more traditional words such as `shortcut' and `tag'. This is one the many ranges of Oxford Dictionaries and the `Pocket' version is aimed at every-day use in a portable format.Not exactly `pocket sized' as it contains over 1,100 pages (and the hardback format adds to the weight) but slightly smaller than an average novel in terms of height and width at least (about 18x12cm) and it really is just the dictionary itself so no waste of space for long appendices, grammar or explanatory notes. It you just want a modern dictionary simply for spelling and definitions then there is no doubt it performs that task."
367,5.0,Very nice dictionary and good size,"  I don't normally give 5x ''''''for rating, but I'll happily do it for this nice dictionary. Nowadays, because of the development of technology, we tend to use all sort of gadgets or the internet to look up the definitions, don't we? But I believe that in order to 'engrave' a new word or a definition in your brain you'll need to make some effort, such as turning pages to find the word and read it, i.e. in the paper dictionary. I think it's so easy to find the definition in the internet, but it's also so easy to forget it by simply reading it on-line. But I love the 'old' fashioned way of researching into the mystery world.I'm glad I got this dictionary, because it's not too big or too small, hot too heavy, so you can carry it around in your rucksack if necessary. It's called a 'pocket dictionary', but it's not so small. It's more or less the same size as a Harry Potter book (hardback) - nice size! I hope you enjoy using it too, and you agree with me that using a paper dictionary can help you learn all the new words more easily."
368,5.0,The dictionary with a neat little twist,"  My last Oxford dictionary was purchased in 1980 and has been a God-send ever since. However, aware of the change in the English language, I decided a new, up-to-date dictionary was long overdue and chose the Pocket Oxford English Dictionary. The dictionary exceeded my expectations. Perhaps a little too large to pop into a pocket, this dictionary, however, is very user-friendly. Grey spacers down the outside edge show where the letters of the alphabet change to make it easier to find a word you are looking for. The book also includes a short history of Oxford dictionaries and a guide on how to use the dictionary, including abbreviations and pronunciations. What I particularly liked about this dictionary are the spelling, usage and etymology notes dotted throughout the dictionary, some of the noted information I had not even been aware of, despite being an author, and which I will find invaluable in the future for my next projects. I highly recommend this dictionary for use at home, school and in the office."
369,5.0,Excellent for The Scrabble Players.,"  The title says it all really. That's the reason that I ordered the book, to prevent the arguments about whether a word is valid or not in Scrabble.It's a lovely book, beautifully laid out in alphabetical order (as you would expect with a dictionary).The type is crystal clear and the word meanings easy to read and understand, it has the usual appendices associated with a dictionary and the cover is eye catching and quite sturdy.The only thing is that whoever decided to name this a pocket dictionary must have larger pockets because it won't fit into any I know.If you want a great explanation of all the words that make up our illustrious language than look no further than this book."

372,5.0,Excellent,  I was rather surprised that the Pocket Oxford English Dictionary was offered on the Vine programme as it is possibly the best know dictionary of the English language.  Despite being described as the pocket edition this volume is rather too thick to be carried in a pocket. For this reason I am not sure it really has a purpose.  As it is too bulky for easy transport it faces competition from the Concise Oxford dictionary.  Saying that however the pocket edition does have all the vocabulary that is likley to be commonly encountered.

374,4.0,Hope You've Got Big Pockets?,"  Ha! You'll certainly need them for this pocket dictionary. I've noticed before that Oxford seem to have a different understanding of the word 'pocket', to everyone else...I suppose we could look it up in a dictionary :).  Over a thousand pages too. A star off for that then , but it's a great edition of course, and I'm recommending the Pocket Oxford Dictionary to all. Ideal to have around the home or office."
375,5.0,Modern up to date and convenient,  This is a good sized portable dictionary that is up to date with the developing english language. It is well set out and easy to use and to read. It is authorative. Not that light but a good size for a school bag or a brief case. Recommended.
376,4.0,Handy and informative,"  Hardly pocket sized, unless you usually carry a shotgun in yours... it is however a fantastic source of information. Very easy to navigate and use. This copy is for my daughter to use at Grammar school, but will probably get another for use at home."
377,3.0,"Badly titled, barely adequate.","  In no way could this be described as a ""pocket"" dictionary""; is it ironic that a dictionary, of all books, should be so erroneously titled?Unfortunately, its size is a real drawback. It is too large and heavy to be constantly carried around, either in a particularly large pocket, or even in a briefcase or schoolbag; and it is not large enough to contain all the information you may need. So, if it is not portable, why would anyone choose this rather abridged edition, rather than a more comprehensive, if slightly larger, version, of which there are many available?As it so clearly falls between two stools I could not recommend that anyone purchase this edition. I can guarantee that you will find an alternative better suited to your requirements."
378,5.0,Just the job,"  The Pocket Oxford has undergone a few modernisations and changes since I last possessed one. The text is now in a sans-serif font, giving clarity and a clean look to the whole enterprise. In amongst the straight alphabetical definitions the text now includes call-out boxes giving additional information, spelling reminders, grammatical hints, and other pieces of useful information (although if you've already found 'hierarchy' in the dictionary, surely it's a bit late to remind the user that it is spelt h*ie*r-?)The word definitions are as clear, concise and informative as you would expect. New words for this edition come mainly from the online world, with words such as cybersecurity and hashtag making a new completely appearance, whilst words such as tag and favourite have their new usages noted.The process of reducing the 2 billion words of the master database, the Oxford English Corpus, to the 120 thousand represented in the Pocket Oxford must be a thankless one - rauschpfeife continues to be ignored by the Pocket Oxford for example; but I was pleased to see zygote continues to occupy the final position.An essential reference work, an indispensable source of reference and of curiosity. Online dictionaries proliferate, but none match the immediacy and excellence of the Pocket Oxford."
379,5.0,Excellent,  A very clear layout makes this disctionary easy to use.  This is a concise book yet has sufficient entries.  A good size.
380,1.0,Not Good At All,  Extremely disappointing for an Oxford Dictionary.Way too big to be a 'pocket' dictionary as such and the content is way too thin and incomplete to be of use to a writer and cod-journalist like myself.The acid test for a dictionary is if it has  a good selection of cuss words and slang.This has neither.Real shame to see dictionaries declining in the digital age but this falls way short of the markNot recommended.
381,5.0,Hands down THE BEST investment for learning!,"  Oxford dictionary is the first book my dad bought me and it‚Äôs been my best knowledge companion throughout my school days. Thought I‚Äôd return the favor and bought this for my 5 year old daughter and she just loves it! She‚Äôs starting to learn the words only now but shows great interest in finding the words in the dictionary even if it‚Äôs just a three lettered sight word. Personally, I cannot imagine finishing the academic years without Oxford English Dictionary."

391,5.0,Five Stars,  The best dictionary for English Majors!
392,4.0,"Remember, it's an ENGLISH dictionary","  Just published and a pocket dictionary, this new edition is easy to use while I write, but it's an English dictionary, not American, so the definitions are not always what you expect and it doesn't have many American words you know and love, especially popular slang like ""Bozo"". However, it's well laid out and easy to find words. I definitely recommand it. I wait ernestly for a current  Anerican version to be published to replace my old one."
393,5.0,My choice for the dictionary on my writing desk.,  This Pocket Oxford English Dictionary feels comfortable to have at hand on my writing desk. The print size is just large enough to be readable for my old eyes without a magnifier. The reputation of OED says the rest.
394,5.0,This one is a great tool to get the meaning of words without translate,"  This one is a great tool to get the meaning of words without translate. Plus, it is really well made."

396,5.0,Excellent condition and received on time as expected.,  I received the dictionary on time and it is in excellent condition. I would love this. Thanks a lot.
397,2.0,Not What I Wanted,  Didn't come close to the one I was looking for.  I have a very small dictionary which is named The New Little Oxford Dictionary which is leather.  I wanted one just like it however it is out of print and I cannot find another.  Naturally this one works however it is larger than I expected.
398,5.0,Very Helpful,"  Finally, an up-to-date dictionary.  This one is the most recent one I found and it is packed with imformation.  A good buy"
399,1.0,One Star,  First time I tried to look up a simple word - it was not listed.  Sent this back
400,1.0,"An incomplete work even for a ""pocket"" edition.","  I have an old American made pocket dictionary from Webster that is much better but was wearing out, it was published in 1945.I was disappointed when I opened this 2013 dictionary and saw many 2nd and 3rd meanings missing, even lacking brief mention. Thus the historical terminology that we broad reading book lovers need is not to be found.Example:The King James Bible, in publication for over 400 years, is also of British origin, and should be definition-supported as a major English work. But Oxford lacks the 2nd definition of the word Publican which the KJ uses. A publican was a tax collector when Rome ruled the world but Oxford does not tell you so. On page 731 they write: publican n. Brit. a person who owns or manages a pub - ORGIN Latin publicanus.Imagine the heyday that extreme moralists who are against alcohol drinking can make with this as this they falsely think that the Bible directly puts down publicans (pub [drinking establishment] operators as Oxford falsely says) as the worst of sinners when in fact the Bible means tax collectors! Such obfuscation! Such misinformation!Other definitions are similar in being too short even for a pocket dictionary. You will think wrong things if you use such a mediocre dictionary. It upsets me to think that a dictionary could lead me so astray. Those giving a positive review of this have not had enough time with it to know that it is poor.The editors for this dictionary obviously lack a broad reading background and knowledge of word use in the major writings of  English. I will go back to my tattered old pocket dictionary from 1945 until an overhaul is made by Oxford.Reference in support of above statement:Publicans is used in a passage telling you to separate from a person, who is to you, as bad as a Publican: Matthew 18:17 ... but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. [...]"
401,1.0,Terrible dictionary.,"  Almost every time I tried to look-up a word, it was not in this dictionary.  As noted in the description, it only has 120,000 words;  something I missed when I looked at the description and reviews when making my decision to purchase it.  Not worth the money and I don't recommend the Pocket Oxford English Dictionary for any purpose.  It should be advertised as a severely abridged guide to the English language."
