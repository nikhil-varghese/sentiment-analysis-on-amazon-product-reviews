8,5,My book arrived! Undamaged and in reasonable time.,"  Well, despite (as yet) not ever meeting Richard Dawkins, we are seemingly kindred spirits and the more of his words I read the more I am convinced! I actually came to his writing rather late but being well aware of his opinions and delivery through his various television appearances - his tomes do not disappoint - his command and breath of language impressive. I commend all his works and especially to anyone of a religious persuasion.",0

14,5,Notable update to a classic ...,"  This is the '40th Anniversary' edition of the book ... but not exactly a new edition. It's a volume that actually contains the 2nd edition of the book, with revisions and the prefaces and forwards. It adds a new epilogue for this edition, as well as two chapters from a different book ""The Extended Phenotype"". Thus the new title ""The Extended Selfish Gene"". Having read the first edition 40 years ago, this re-read was somewhat nostalgic and a reminder of how controversial the original was. This was never a technical book on genetics, but an argument for an interpretation of the process of natural selection at the gene level. Many technical and popular reviewers at the time imposed some personal and wrong-headed interpretations to the meaning of the term 'selfish' gene, to which this edition is a counterargument. Perhaps the most interesting parts of the book are in fact the endnotes to each chapter, and should be read as noted when they occur.  These provide more of the historical changes.Needless to say perhaps, but as the 'modern synthesis' provided a new context to Darwin's ideas when the gene was explored scientifically, the concept of the selfish gene has become even more important with the rigorous sequencing of the full genome of viruses, bacteria, higher organisms and humans, and the discovery of regulatory genetic elements.Nature continues to amaze ...",0
15,5,What is life and how does it evolve?,"  The Selfish Gene is a classic in exploring how Darwin's theory of evolution operates deeply within living things. Even if one is not entirely comfortable with Dawkin's perspective, this work offers the opportunity to tread the fine line between highly technical insights into biological processes and a generalized paradigm of how life works at the genetic level.",0
16,5,Even if you ascribe to the organism level side of the debate I think you can't help but like this book.,  I experienced Dawkins's writing in reverse order. I had enjoyed all of his books and this was the last one that I read. This book being his first book it maybe a bit odd that I got to reading it last but it was still educational and this revised version is excellent. He includes small updates from his later works giving new depth to a game changing argument for the gene centered view of evolution by natural selection. In my biology classes having experienced so much of RD's thought on the subject before having the formal education I was able to see clearly so many things that I think would have been difficult to conceptualize. If you have never read the Selfish Gene before you will love this book at least if you love science.,0

25,4,Box set version of the classic book,"  The EXTENDED Selfish Gene feels like it's a ""box set"" type of thing, except for only one book. It contains all the Forewords, Introductions, Endnotes, Commentaries, Special Director's Cuts (oops, that's DVD's - I hope you get what I mean) from all of the various editions of Dawkins' classic. It's something made for fans of Dawkins, people who have followed his career, read his books, paid attention to the impacts and reactions to this book and his other books.When you get a DVD movie, first, maybe you watch the trailer first, but then you watch the movie.  All the extra stuff - the interviews, the outtakes, etc -  you watch later. Same for this book. It has a TON of the extra stuff that you check later, after reading the main text of the book.The book itself is basically the same book, and has been reviewed a jillion times, so I won't bother trying to add to that. But I will say, as a first-time reader of the book, that all the extra stuff made it a touch (not a lot) more difficult to read -- because, for example, The Foreward to The Second Edition really didn't mean anything to me, as it talked about response to the original and such. I just wanted to read the book!  After I finished, then going back and reading all the extra stuff was interesting, but still, I didn't really care, because I'm just not a Dawkins fanboy.The Selfish Gene is a good, perhaps great book. It's worth reading for just about anyone, no matter how much they already know (or think they know) about evolution. This version of it is made for Dawkins fans.",0
26,4,My Second Attempt,"  There are many videos of Richard Dawkins on youtube, and I enjoy them all.  You could say that I am a Dawkins fan.  However, something happens when I read  Dawkins’ books.  It’s as if I’m reading something written by an entirely different person than the person I enjoy so much in the videos. And his books get nothing but 5-star reviews…tons of them.  I have therefore concluded that the fault lies with me…not with Richard Dawkins and the rest of the civilized world. I have tried reading three of Dawkins’ books…The Selfish Gene (twice), The Ancestor’s Tale, and Brief Candle In The Dark.  None have resonated positively with me.  I have considered reading The God Delusion, but Richard’s views coincide with my own views in the matter 100% so I don’t see the point of reading The God Delusion. The Selfish Gene was published in 1976 and I bought it perhaps in 1977.  I was interested in the subject, and I anticipated that I would enjoy the book.  And it began well enough to draw me in.  But it eventually began to become tedious.  I slogged along for a while, but eventually I put the book aside. And then, in 2017, The Selfish Gene popped up as an offering to members of Vine Voice.  I had read quite a bit about genes etc in the intervening years, and I decided to give The Selfish Gene (Extended version) a second chance. I read with enjoyment all the Introductions to Previous Editions etc., and I looked forward once again to reading the book.  And once again, I enjoyed the early chapters.  Then slowly but surely, I found myself slogging along through muddy waters.  So I jumped to the two chapters at the end of the book taken from The Extended Phenotype.  These chapters clarified some issues for me, but muddied others.  Then in front of the two new chapters I found a collection of extracts from reviews written by people I admire…W.D.Hamilton, Peter Medawar, and John Maynard Smith and I read these extracts.  These gentlemen convinced me that there must be something wrong with me and the way I read, rather than with Richard Dawkins and the way he writes. So, one day, I will make a third attempt at reading this book.  But not now.",0
27,5,A serious book for the intelligent general reader on the origins of life on earth.,"  The Selfish Gene was first published in 1976 and brought fame to evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, an emeritus professor at Oxford University.  The Extended Selfish Gene, the 40th Anniversary Edition of his famous book was published in November, 2016.  This new edition has been revised and expanded and now includes two chapters from his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype.At 560 tightly organized and focused pages, readers are going to need much time and effort to digest Dawkins’s theories about evolutionary biology.  Each chapter of the book includes Endnotes at the back of the book and these notes are extensive and important to fully understand the points Dawkins makes in his text.  These Endnotes slow down the reading of the text, which is not a bad thing, for this book is not meant to be read quickly, but slowly, deliberately, and with much thoughtful analysis.Dawkins is first and foremost a scientist who carefully examines the evidence available to us for understanding the evolution of life on this planet.  In his 2006 book The God Delusion he “contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that belief in a personal god qualifies as a delusion, which he defines as a persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory evidence.”  The Extended Selfish Gene is his bible for understanding the development of life on earth.  He tells us early on that he is not “advocating a morality based on evolution.  I am saying how things evolved.”  He knows that he is going to be misunderstood and his is correct in his assessment.  With this new edition of his landmark book he hopes to set the record straight.  That said, he tells us that “The account of the origin of life that I shall give is necessarily speculative.”  Later on he says, “To be strict this book should be called not The Selfish Cistron nor The Selfish Chromosome but The slightly selfish big bit of chromosome….”  Wisely, he settled for The Selfish Gene.  “The gene is the basic unit of selfishness.”The Extended Selfish Gene is a serious book written for the intelligent general reader who wants to understand the science behind the theory of evolution.  It is slow going, at least in part because of the detailed endnotes that elaborate and expand on major points Dawkins makes in his text.  That said, for those interested in the origins of life on earth, this book is likely to be a satisfying reading experience.",0
28,4,The origin of species and the selfish gene,"  Advances in genetics and developmental biology in the last five decades have challenged us to think about the role of genes preparing the species against the challenges of the environment. Biologist Richard Dawkins coins the metaphor “selfish gene” to suggest that genes are tempered by their need to keep their carrier species successful in nature, which is fundamental to its survival in the evolutionary process.A brief summary of the book is as follows: Dawkins argues that the evolutionary concept of Natural Selection chooses specific sets of genes that confer the individual species to behave altruistically. For example, family and social behavior of feeding and protecting a social structure is common among species that share copies of the same genes. Within each individual species, some leave more “fit” offspring that contain some inheritable traits (genes). This non-random differential reproduction of genes is referred to as Natural Selection. A gene by cooperating with group if successful companion gene pools build a mortal machine that survives through a finite time. And all phenotypic effects, a set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from an interaction of its genotype with its environment is present in an individual body. Genes have different functions; some genes are workers, some builders, while others manage the operation as a whole. This helps us understand the complex genetic networks regulating metabolism, reproduction and development. The gene pools give an inside look at the intricate and often surprising adaptations among species. The genetics of immune systems, the evolutionary benefits of sexual reproduction, and genetic differences among human populations are few examples of adaptation and natural selection. For example, humans and chimpanzee share about 99% of their evolutionary history. But how is that humans claim to be more “evolved” than chimpanzees? How did they acquire bigger brains?A comparison of the DNA of chimpanzees and humans showed that a single letter change in the DNA of one gene triggered an increase in a population of stem cells called basal radial glia. These cells are thought to have powered the expansion of the human cerebral cortex. It also seems that chunks of DNA in the human had acquired “back-up copies” of particular genes, That made them ripe for some evolutionary tinkering; if the copy happens to acquire a few coding errors, there’s no problem, there’s still the functioning original. Once in a while however, a copying error might lead to a new function that is useful. A closer look at a duplicated human gene named SRGAP2C is a slightly altered in humans, but the unaltered original gene is found in chimps but the human SRGAP2C, delayed the maturation of neurons so spines kept sprouting, which enabled them to make more connections. Neurons develop and they acquire spines that act like antennae for receiving messages from other neurons. But the spines stop sprouting once the neurons mature, but altered SRGAP2C, by delaying the maturation process help it to get big and develop more connections and increases the complexity of the brain as it happened in humans.Another backup copy of a gene that is present in humans but absent from chimps called ARHGAP11B caused a particular population of brain stem cells – basal radial glia – to increase their rounds of multiplication and grow bigger. The altered FOXP2 gene, unique to humans is responsible for turning thoughts into speech, but the unaltered genome is present in chimps where this evolutionary behavior is absent.This book is 548 pages long and contains very little biological or genetic data. It is written for general readers that require no significant knowledge in evolutionary biology.",0
29,4,"Agree Or Not, This Is A Classic. But Publisher's Offering Of The Classic Disappoints","  You can read literally hundreds, if not thousands, of reviews for this book in all its editions, as well as for The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (Oxford Landmark Science)   (some chapters of which are included in this offering).This is a daunting book, both in the material presented (it's far deeper than my expertise at this point so it's a challenge) and the arguments made. Regardless of whether you fall on the side of Dawkins or on the side that ""opposes"" him this book has made an extraordinarily valuable contribution to the discussion of ""something special vs something not"" (as I call it; for lack of a better descriptor for me/from me at this point).I really can't add much to the discussion (as I said, a) already numerous, well-written, and informed/informative reviews and b) the material is well above my pay grade), but I can add that I very much appreciated the inclusion of all the ""edition introductions, notes, and prefaces."" They help to put the ideas'/book's/author's journeys in some sense of perspective (especially for the non-pro like me).I would like - as pretty much my main (and only?) point - to add to the discussion by commenting on the ""value for money"" aspect of the actual product (as ""value for money"" to me is an integral aspect of a review on Amazon (along with (as they apply) function, materials, & aesthetics)). To be blunt, I'm very disappointed; the ""feel"" of the book is that of a ""Book of the Month"" offering and not an offering from an esteemed publisher such as Oxford. The place holder ribbon - again, to me - only adds insult to injury and really cheapens the overall quality (as do what I think are the unforgivable editing lapses such as ""preict"" on page xvi). In the end, this feels like a hard-covered paperback. Dawkins, as well as his readers, deserve better (and I bet would have paid more to get it).So ""5 stars"" for the material presented (whether you agree or not with it), ""3 stars"" for the package it comes in.4 stars.",0
30,4,A Vital Read for the Curious,"  I first read The Selfish Gene roughly 15 years ago in the 2nd edition. I got this to re-read sections and also for the new material. The material I didn’t get the first time included here are excerpts from The Extended Phenotype as well as some new introductory material and, oddly, some critical reviews of the book.Rather than skip around as I intended, I was again, with the first reading, drawn into the book fascinated by it. I also picked up some added information I may have missed the first time or have forgotten in the ensuing years. For many, including me, Dawkins goes on a bit long in some concepts but if you’ve read enough and wish to skip on to the next topic, it’s easy to do so. Also some will likely either avoid this book or be drawn to it by Dawkins’ very public dismissal of religion. This entire, roughly 600 page book, has perhaps three paragraphs where any mention of ‘god’ exists and these are mild references. If you buy the book expecting a skewering of religion or avoid the book for the same reason, you’re making an error. This book is Dawkins the biologist, not the atheist.I was disappointed in the book not being updated from its late 80’s edition In the text. There remains the rather laughable chapter on the relative investment human males and females make in a pregnancy which is so silly that it’s embarrassing to read. Dawkins, as do many others, wonder why the US did not demonstrate the atomic bomb to Japan rather than using it he being convinced that’d bring Japan to the bargaining table. He misses that the US did do such a demonstration to no effect.In a rather prescient comment that also deserves updating, Dawkins foresaw many elements of computing that few if any predicted back in the 80’s. He also speculates back then on the outcome of trying to raise a gender-neutral child. In the ensuing almost 30 years, many parents (including me) have tried this and we know the outcome. So these elements, and others, due to a lack of updating, strike me as annoying anachronisms. There are, very likely, great strides in the science as well but me not being a biologist current recent research can’t say yes or no.I also recommend, if available, you get this in the Kindle edition. This is a hunk of a book and difficult to manage as well as look at the notes in the dead tree version I was saddled with. Many of the notes really are commentary and would make short magazine articles. Skip the notes and you skip much of the book.Still, despite these mild issues, I recommend the book for any who are interested in nature, behavior and how we came to be. .",0
31,5,Darwin Explained,"  In a different lifetime, I would have become a biologist. Biology has always interested me and I enjoy learning about the many aspects of biology.Because of my lack of a formal science education, my knowledge is spotty and somewhat random. I know parts of Darwin’s theory of evolution but have never thoroughly explored it.This book has been an important key to understanding evolution. It is well ahead of its time and groundbreaking. As I was reading it and came upon the concept of memes, I immediately thought of internet memes and wondered if the two had any connection. It turns out that this book is the origin of the word meme.Dawkins also introduces connectiveness and gaming theory to support his concept of the selfish gene. Since I have special interest in marine fish breeding, I thought he might make errors here. But he generally gets it correct and explains how his theory can be applied here and in many other places.Extended in the title refers to the two additional chapters from his follow up book The Extended Phenotype. I thought it was better explained in Chapter 13. The two added chapters might encourage some to read the next book, but I did not find them as compelling.I did read Mind: A Unified Theory of Life and Intelligence   immediately after finishing this book and think it is a natural progression. That author directly cites this book but then explains where he think Dawkins falls short. It is interesting reading and having the two perspectives is enlightening.",0
32,5,A modern classic of scientific literature in an extended edition,Mind: A Unified Theory of Life and Intelligence,0
33,5,The Gene Machine,"  Controversial when first published and the cause of much consternation because of its use of the word selfish (a behavioral word whose meaning is essentially subjective), Dawkins' gene-centric view of evolution was nevertheless something of a revelation. I was in graduate school at the time, studying molecular biology and evolutionary genetics and I can recall watching some of my more veteran professors' heads exploding whenever this book was brought up for discussion in class. There remains a tinge of teleology about the title that some still find disturbing. Evolution since Darwin is viewed as a random process with changes in organisms that are completely contingent as adaptations to the environment. Successful adaptations tend to be transmitted, unsuccessful changes tend to die out. The process unfolds as essentially blind and mechanistic without purposefulness.Here was the suggestion of something deeper going on, a form of ""genetic determinism"" that hints at direction. It is well that Professor Dawkins is not a theist because this view of evolution in lesser hands might be scientifically problematic. Dawkins' book is refreshingly original in its viewpoint and opens several fascinating lines of thought for the conscientious reader. It includes two significant chapters from a later book: The Extended Phenotype, which help to clarify Professor Dawkins' assertions in The Selfish Gene. This is one of the modern classics of scientific literature and The Extended Selfish Gene is a very fine edition in which to read some very stimulating ideas from a serious evolutionary theoretician.",0
34,4,A classic brought in a 40th Extended Anniversary Edition,"  I had never read The Selfish Gene, so this fortieth anniversary edition provided the perfect opportunity to read what may be the most influential (among laypeople as well as scientists) book on evolutionary theory since Darwin.As Dawkins says, it would be extremely unlikely that a book that's been around this long would not need updating, if not junking entirely. But, except for possibly changing the title from The Selfish Gene to something like The Immortal Gene, Dawkins doesn't want to change anything fundamental in the book. He's satisfied with the book as it stands.To update his thought in the last decades, Dawkins includes two chapters from his book The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene.Dawkins begins by looking at groups of molecules (one type of which are genes) as replicators—molecules that make copies of themselves. Dawkins resists the “group selection” theory in Konrad Lorenz's On Aggression Robert Ardrey's The Social Contract.One thing I liked about this book was the variety of examples from zoology that Dawkins uses to illustrate his points. I've read a lot of science books that are full of abstruse theory with little relation to the real world.I skipped around in reading the chapters, and one of the first I went to was the chapter on “Memes: The New Replicators.” It was interesting reading how Dawkins first introduced a scientific concept that is now ubiquitous in our world of social media.",0
35,5,The updated version available through Amazon's excellent Vine program,"  A long standing classic in the field of genetic studies, Richard Dawkins book The Selfish Gene is being celebrated in this 40th Anniversary edition, released by Oxford University Press, with the modified title, ""The Extended Selfish Gene"" which includes ""two key chapters from The Extended Phenotype"", a book published six years after ""The Selfish Gene"" primarily for professionals of the field. The bulk of the book, contains prefaces to the first, second and 30th Anniversary editions, followed by the book itself. I need not go over the importance or popularity of the book, as there are a plethora of reviews on various listings that will cover the contents. So I will remark on this particular edition itself, as nothing of the book has been changed.A short one-page preface by the author remarking his experience concerning the book and the appraisal he has been given ever since is responded with humility and gratitude. The Extended Phenotype was included, chapters two and three, as clarifications of some misunderstandings that has occurred surrounding adaptation of the gene, as well as whether it is deterministic or not. A selective index was also included in this edition. This also includes a ""40th Anniversary Epilogue"".Oxford releases this in a hardcover edition with an inlaid red ribbon. While I have purchased Oxford books in the past, I can't help feel that this is a fairly cheap quality overall. The paper feels almost like newsprint, and the weight of the book is light weight and the size is about the size of a trade paperback or book club edition. While these do not take away the contents of the book, it certainly diminishes something as a 40th Anniversary Edition. The book Selfish Gene is also available in a paperback edition as a ""40th Anniversary Edition: as well as ""The Extended Phenotype"" in its full form, both by Oxford in their ""Landmark Science Series"". Given that, I am not sure who this edition will ultimately serve. The person who has never read it? Or the person who has not read Extended Phenotype but only wants to read two chapters?I am giving the book 4 stars primarily for the importance of the book and its contents, but I am removing a star simply for the fact that this edition does not seem serve a purpose besides Oxford looking to promote the book itself and his other book. Again, both are available in their updated version, so there is nothing exclusive to this book.",0
36,5,"Erudite, accessible and enlightening","  I originally bought this book following some readings in microbiologist.It certainly made for interesting reading not only because of the lack of any mathematical treatments but because of the clarity of the exposition and the strength of the case that Dawkins made.Written for the educated, though non-specialist reader, the text kept my attention throughout and I found myself gaining a perspective on social sciences which my prior readings had only hinted at.The updated version available through Amazon's excellent Vine program, gave me a great opportunity to engage with this text again which I was delighted to.The addition of two chapters of the Extended Phenotype certainly clarify some of Dawkins thinking from prior editions but i believe that they only strengthen his case. They certainly deal well with critic's attacks and one particular slight passage stood out about an applicant who came from a family of creationists wishing to study , presumably to find fault with the scientific approach.This is an excellent book which has stood the tests of time and criticism and which continues to be recommended reading for the educated, non-specialist reader.",0
37,5,The extended version amplifies the concepts we are already familiar with,"  Richard Dawkins' Selfish Gene is a classic, now in its 4th-decade enlightening lay people and scholars alike.  To honor that accomplishment, Oxford Press has published the even more informative  Extended Selfish Gene, including two important chapters from The Extended Phenotype.  The result is an even more satisfying and remarkable work that succinctly and painstakingly walks readers through the irrefutable biological and evolutionary evidence that we are, innately programmed or genetically ""wired"" toward selfishness.  Indeed, even our altruism is biased toward extended the existence of our genes and chromosomes.With a penchant for helpful metaphors, the author explains the difference between cells, genes, and chromosomes--how they operate and how,  without conscious effort, they manage to continually replicate themselves through the generations.  In the process, Dawkins discusses the notion that bodies that carry them (our ""selves"") are little more (to genes) little more than encasements, designed for the sole purpose of keeping the genes on a survival trajectory.  Along the way he elaborates on some fascinating subjects: the reason genes triggering disease often wait til after fertility to activate; why aggression works as a survival strategy but only to a point; why altruism has a place in a survival strategy, particularly among family members; and why there seem to be battles among generations and the sexes.The additional discussion of memes and phenotypes is a real plus as is the addition of footnotes which were absent from earlier editions.  Dawkins makes a point of elaborating with footnotes assertions that were controversial or bones of contention with other biologists--Stephen J. Gould seems to have had particular difficulty appreciating the concept of a Selfish Gene.  Most will not though and this extended version is a real treat for lovers of science everywhere.",0
38,5,"The Anniversary edition of  a science classic, extended to include critiques and more.","  This book is meaty, no corners are cut here. This book is an extended version of a prior publication but it includes The Extended Phenotype which is relevant to the whole concept discussed in the work. Controversial or not this book will elicit a lot of thought and dissonant emotions, plus an overview into our biology that helps get a wider understanding of what we are as a species. Although I must say that the book having been written. decades ago is facing a lot of competition from current research and understanding that was at hand initially. If you are aware of the book's controversy and who is Richard Dawkins you might have an expectation as what is in the book. However I do recommend to read the introduction and preface to the book, the insight is invaluable to be able to understand the concept of why this book is relevant or what its purpose is.While you don't have to be a science or sociology major to benefit from this book, this book does require some basic comprehension of evolutionary theory. It contains a lot of information, which is well organized and discussed but it is a research book after all. Not much sexy stuff happening here.Book's destiny: Nerd shelf rockstar",0
39,4,"Five starts, but","  I have very much enjoyed reading the Extended Selfish Gene.  The book is aptly titled as it includes the 40th anniversary edition of The Selfish Gene, along with selected reviews and critiques, and 2 chapters from The Extended Phenotype.Dr. Dawkins is a scientist's scientist and rare intellectual. In both books, and response to his critics he examines the issue,. or objection from a number of angles to ascertain best fit.  He reasons from a thorough knowledge of biology and philosophy maintaining a dialectic with some of the great scientific minds of our time.  Even though I read both of these books when released I enjoyed revisiting them for the level of discourse.  I do not know how I was so oblivious to the controversies surrounding the books, except that I was engaged in my own research in another field.  It seems that much was simple misunderstanding, though there are certainly those with more substantive, if not scientific, objections.  I have to say that I am amazed and impressed by the diplomacy with which he handled some of the criticism.I am very glad to once again have a copy of this book, having handed mine to my daughter as she was starting a program in biomedical engineering, and then was sorry to not have a copy to give to her brother, currently studying machine learning (and astrophysics) because although not directly relevant, it is a science classic and a masterpiece of intellectual reasoning.  I believe it deserves a space on the bookshelf of any scientist , maybe even any intellectual.  It is an area worth understanding, and his reasoning, a delight to read.",0
40,3,Save money and get more content by buying the books separately.,"  This review is less about content than presentation--the content is well worth your while and you should read the Selfish Gene--just not this edition. If you've already read The Selfish Gene, there's not enough new information to justify this book. The ""extended"" material is two chapters from another book (The Extended Phenotype). It would be cheaper, and you'd get more information (the entire Extended Phenotype) to buy the books separately. Had the two books been integrated and updated, it might have been worthwhile, but as it stands, it feels more like a money grub than a good read.",4
41,5,Genetics of being a 'nice guy' and other stuff explored to a depth,"  This is a very interesting book for anyone that is interested in science, religion or just curious to understand some of the most basic questions in life.Example: there is a chapter which starts off with the principle of what a nice guy or a nice person is ? Fairly simple is it not ?  As per Dawkins - he explores the concept of a nice person with a simple explanation and goes into such a depth dedicating a whole chapter to it.Similarly some very simple concepts which we would have not even thought about is explored in great detail.  There are other good examples about how a particular species of bird in Australia teaches its offsprings to repeat its song ... and this is explained in detail on how we try to preserve our culture and genes.Does not matter if you agree with Dr Dawkins on religion etc... this is a beautiful supplement to the classic which came out decades earlier",0
42,4,Attractive 40th Anniversary Edition of a Modern Classic,"  This is the 40th Anniversary edition of this classic book.  The text is basically the 2nd edition of the book with the addition of two chapters from another of his books The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene  .  These two chapters address various critiques of the original Selfish Gene edition.  This is classical Darwinian thought updated to argue for the process of natural selection occuring at the gene level.  This volume also includes a new introduction.The 40th Anniversary edition is very attractive and has a number of good design features - it even has a book ribbon!  Unfortunately, the binding on my copy is not quite tight and the bottoms of some of the pages at the front and end of the book are loose, but not falling out (at least, not yet).",0

44,5,An important book with a wealth of significant information,  This is a updated but not really revised version of Dawkin's original book. It has a new epilogue in a couple of extra chapters from another book of his. These additions make it better than the original if that's even possible. I still consider this Dawkin's best book. The man's writing style and clear explanations are a joy to read. A great book by a great biologist that anyone interested in the field should read whether you agree with all of his ideas are not. This work was very influential and is very highly recommended.,0
45,3,The cooperative publisher.,"  This is an eye-opening classic, reissued because of its significant content and expanded. Usually, scientific books such as those which examine esoteric subjects such as genes is hard to read, full of jargon, and requires readers to have an extensive scientific background to even get to first base in the book; readers are lost within the first chapter, and often fail to finish it. This is not so in any of Dawkins' books. This book is easy to read and, as I said, it is eye-opening.It is Dawkins' first book, the book that made him famous. It was written forty years ago. But it is still very relevant. It is updated and contains new material as well as extracts from reviews.Dawkins’ original book provoked debate, some unkind, and, as a result, he wrote “The Extended Phenotype,” to explain his view. This somewhat updated volume contains two key chapters from this second book.",0
46,4,"Good read, but not as ""groundbreaking"" as the original","  This is a tough one to assess as I wholeheartedly recommend the Selfish Gene to anyone with even a passing interest in a gene centered view of evolution. For readers of the 2nd edition of the Selfish Gene, the only substantive updated information here is the addition of the first two chapters of The Extended Phenotype and I suppose another opportunity for the author to respond to criticisms of his postulations.Beyond that, unless one has some imperative to collect every version of a particular work, there's not much here to justify a re-read. In fact, I came away feeling like the addition of the chapters from the later book were a greater distraction than benefit.",0
47,5,"Not really an update of original book, but addition of some later writing by Dawkins - Great writing, great reading!","  Sequels sometimes miss the mark and are not as engaging as the original, especially if the topic was considering ""groundbreaking"" at the time.I feel like the topics covered in this extended edition have been done elsewhere, so it lacked the ""wow!"" factor for me, but your mileage may vary.  Overall, still an engaging read.",0
48,5,Updated version of a timeless classic,"  This books pulls together ""The Selfish Gene"" from 40 years ago and adds in  two chapters from the 1982 book ""The Extended Phenotype"", in which  he responded to criticism of the earlier book. There is some updating here, including an epilogue to The Selfish Gene.  This is science writing at its best, both covering a major topic of research (evolutionary biology) and using an absolutely clear engaging writing style to cover technical topics.  I read ""Selfish Gene"" nearly 20 years ago, and it was just as interesting now as then, with additional material helping me understand the topic better now.Great reading - Highly recommended!",0
49,5,Amazing read,"  Dawkins book was controversial when it came out, and both it and he remain so to this day. This edition adds additional material to the 2nd edition so if you've never encountered The Selfish Gene before, this is the one to get. A great addition to any intelligent thinker's library, whether you agree with him or not.",0
50,5,One Volume that Packs a Wallop,"  'The Selfish Gene,' first published in 1976, is one of the most influential books of our time. It presented a gene-based theory of evolution to the general public.Much of the book's success is the result of the outstanding writing of Richard Dawkins. It renders accessible a topic that otherwise might well have appeared forbidding to general readers.'The Extended Selfish Gene"" usefully includes introductory materials from prior editions, as well as new materials. Many readers will find particular value in the critiques that are addressed. The result is one-volume work that will be welcomed by experts as well as newbies to the evolutionary issues.",3
51,5,"A wonderful addition to The Selfish Gene, but does not mean The Extended Phenotype should be skipped","  A bit of a misnomer, the ""Extended"" version of Dawkins' original Selfish Gene really just adds a couple of chapters from another book, ""The Extended Phenotype"" and adds an new epilogue to close out the book. Otherwise, I can't really seem to find anything new about The Selfish Gene portion itself. Having said that, this is still a must-read in my view, and I'm not sure if it really includes enough to skip The Extended Phenotype. Either way, I think I still rate The God Delusion as my favorite Dawkins title.",0
52,5,the asterisk remarks are the best part,"  Apart from changing the numbering of the pages because the font is different - so all my old page number notes no longer work, and adding a few extra introductions most of which were there and are back again, there are a few things that makes this a worthwhile addition to the thirty year old text - or the one from 1989, and that are the asterisk remarks that add interesting retorts to some criticisms that came up along the way. The appendices are also a plus since this book represents not simply the text everyone really goes to see Richard Dawkins about but the social, academic place the book has achieved.",0
53,4,Worthy Information But Superfluous Publication … Only 13 Pages are Truly “New”,"  Did this 40th year celebratory version of The Selfish Gene need to be published? No. Why not? Because the only truly new information in this 4th edition is a 13-page epilogue by Richard Dawkins.Does The Extended Selfish Gene need to be read? Not really. Adding a 13-page epilogue and 2 chapters from The Extended Phenotype (“Genetic Determinism and Gene Selectionism” and “Constraints on Perfection”) does not make the book “new” or any less derivative of itself.For information’s sake, it is better to have read and/or purchased each title individually.Does Richard Dawkins need to be read at all? Well, of course. Dawkins was in fact the original “meme maker” in 1976. Conceptually, memes are hugely popular in current culture, politics, and conversation. The word itself is used daily by talking heads unfamiliar with its back story in adaptation and replication.Geneticists and evolutionary biologists will still get a chuckle from Richard Dawkins ascribing the character trait of selfishness to a gene. And others who dismissed the earlier Extended Phenotype will hardly be swayed by including 2 chapters from it or his new epilogue in this edition of The Selfish Gene.Still, for one person’s perspective of evolution and natural selection, The Extended Selfish Gene is worthwhile. Dawkin’s books do provoke both controversy and imagination. They are bewitching and vexingly neo-Darwin-istic with densely florid language built of subtle yet significant made-up words such as “selectionism”,Dawkin’s intent is to unify rather than fall into reductionism, so there is that trap avoided. He does admit to some faulty reasoning and misuse of terminology (to wit, culture being ""advantageous"" in evolution), which is quite rare for a famous author to do. And his work has given much fodder to authors such as Daniel C. Dennet, who has out-meme-ed the original meme-er in far more informationally-dense books such as Darwin’s Dangerous Idea.",0
54,4,Two new chapters to a 40 year old classic,"  This is the 40th anniversary of the publication of Richard Dawkins' first book The Selfish Gene.  This book does not update the original text but instead adds two new chapters.  It's interesting reading his thoughts/predictions about computers, parenting, etc with 40 years of hindsight. This book is mostly about biology and has very little discussion about religion in case you were hoping for that or planning to avoid it because of that.",0
55,5,A must read,"  This is the classic re-thinking , or expansion on the evolutionary theory since darwin himself. This brings forth a new edition with a new extension to whet the appetite of those that would carry the torch of reason and fact forward. Not an ""easy"" read, but an accessible read for those that want a better understanding of evolutionary thought and science. A must read for evolutionary scientists.",0
56,4,Original Text with Updated Views -- Excellent!,"  I read the original in the 70s and, while not an update of the original text, it does add additional writings.  Most helpful was the long intro section which updates Dr Dawkins views and provides additional info on what has happened during the intervening years.  Get this if you want to reread the original text with an added manuscript and updated information.  Otherwise, the original text stands the test of time.",0
57,2,I read her essays and books before reading Darwin's THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND ANIMALS and scientists like Donald Griffin,"  I've had a long hate-hate relationship with this book and I was hoping that upon a fresh reading of the book I might feel differently than I have in the past. Unfortunately, reading this extended edition has merely reconfirmed my previous feeling.I'm not an expert on evolutionary theory, but in reading Darwin and a few ethologists the impression that I've gotten is that the higher step on the evolutionary ladder is not selfishness or supreme self-concern, but empathy, compassion, and sympathy. ""The Compassionate Gene"" would be a title for a more nuanced, sophisticated, and accurate project. I will confess that my thinking on this has been greatly influenced by Mary Midgley, who  has frequently crossed pens with Professor Dawkins in British academic journals and magazines. More than any other Anglo-American philosopher, Midgley has taken seriously the idea that humans are not separate and above the animal world, but a part of it. Her interest in ethology and animal behavior is distinct from an interest in evolutionary theory, but her knowledge of that is profound. I read her essays and books before reading Darwin's THE EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS IN MAN AND ANIMALS and scientists like Donald Griffin, and this has shaped an understanding of human behavior that sees compassionate behavior as normative, not selfish inclinations. Moreover, I see little to no scientific evidence for any of Dawkins's claims and nothing in his position helps me understand human behavior, not the way that such recent works in cognitive science lik Steven Pinker's THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE: WHY VIOLENCE HAS DECLINED, or an animal behaviorists such as Frans de Waal. This is not to say that humans are incapable of violence or selfish behavior. That would be absurd. But I don't see any evidence of selfishness being primal in a way that compassion is not. In fact, there is something wrong with someone who is selfish to the exclusion of any capacity for love or sympathy. We think that someone who is especially selfish to be broken. I hate to introduce politics into this, but as I write this American democracy is in danger of being broken by a president who seems willing to destroy the rule of law because a special prosecutor has apparently made discoveries that endangers his presidency. So instead of allowing the investigation to proceed unimpeded, he seems tempted to destroy faith and confidence in all of our nations ideals and institutions, because that is not in his own self-interest. He seems to think, ""Better that I destroy the FBI, the independence of the Justice Department, the national confidence in our court systems, than I be found guilty of wrong doing."" We think such a person to be selfish to an unusual degree, not that he is especially human by being this self-concerned.  On the other hand, we think of deeply compassionate individuals as representing the best of humanity, our idea of ideal humans, not that they are less human or subhuman. Darwin himself denied that selfish, individualistic behavior was the highest point of evolution, but instead that compassionate, cooperative, deeply social behavior was. But, then, Dawkins's ideas have little to nothing to do with Darwin, but instead is much closer to T. H. Huxley and the hyper individualist Herbert Spencer. Dawkins's starting position seems to assume the truth of social darwinism, whereas Darwin would have repudiated social darwinism (I refuse to capitalize the ""d"" in social darwinism, because to do so would seem to link those ideas to Darwin himself, which would have pained him as much as Karl Marx would have been horrified at Soviet Russia claiming to be a Marxist state).Instead of Dawkins's book, which I truly do think is a very, very bad book, I would recommend any of another texts. I mentioned Darwin's book on emotions in humans and animals. It is extremely readable and shows a side of Darwin that might surprise many. Pinker has written a follow up to  THE BETTER ANGELS OF OUR NATURE and recommend both books. Midgley's complaints with the kind of ideas found in Dawkins's book can be found in a number of her books, such as BEAST AND MAN and ANIMALS AND WHY THEY MATTER, but the single best place would be THE SOLITARY SELF: DARWIN AND THE SELF GENE. The latter is a superb example of the kind of supreme common sense that many of the best British thinkers can evince. Now 98 years old, she is the last surviving member of the first generation of professional women philosophers in England. Just off topic for a second, I have often wished that someone would find a way to do a mini series about this remarkable group of women. They include such figures as Irish Murdoch, Elizabeth Anscombe, Mary Warnock, Midgley, and the very great Philippa Foot. Most of them moved to London during WW II and that is where I'd love to see this mini-series taking place, as Murdoch and Foot room together in London, with Murdoch engaging in one affair after another, including one with the man that Foot was quietly in love with (Michael Foot, whom she married and whose name she obviously took), with the brilliant and abrasive Anscombe exploding on the scene",0
58,5,brilliant,"  The book was written in the seventies, but still has good solid science. It is written very well, and easy to read. This issue is updated with numerous footnotes with additions and corrections and explanations, plus there are two chapters from The Extended Phenotype book added for better understanding of the material and to refute some erroneous interpretations of the theory.",0
59,5,"Relevant reading for all, small print book.","  There is no denying the relevance of The Selfish Gene. It is a hard read for some as it makes you question many aspects of your life, of life in general. This Extended version is a quality book with included book marker. One note for those with bad vision, the words are small print.",0
60,5,Over Twice the Length of the Original,"  Much more than an ""extension,"" this book is much longer than the first version. It is the 40th anniversary ed with additional material, added notes, and some new introductory material.",0
61,3,"blah, meh, talk talk talk","  Nothing new from Dawkins here. Maybe he needed to pay the rent or buy a new jet. This is just a rehashing of the Selfish Gene with what is claimed to be new ""evidence"" but not really that new if you keep up with the scientific papers.If anything, I thought the writing was more monotonous in this one, less anecdotal, and less bang for the buck.I'd prefer a shortened Selfish Gene.",0
