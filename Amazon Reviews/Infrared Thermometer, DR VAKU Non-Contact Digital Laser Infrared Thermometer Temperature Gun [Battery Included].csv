Shocking to see the seller sent made in china cheap and defective product while description says certified made in india product. Absolutely useless, shows incorrect temperature. Opened, tried and packed back as its completely useless. Noone should ever trust this seller or buy from Dr Vaku. Really they think buyers are uneducated or what?",4
